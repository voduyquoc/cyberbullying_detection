## Terraform Infrastructure Setup

Create a [S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html) named: `tf-state-mlops-zoomcamp-cyberbullying`
```bash
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket tf-state-mlops-zoomcamp-cyberbullying --region <your-default-aws-region> --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=<your-default-aws-region>
```

Change directory to the `terraform` folder.

```bash
cd cyberbullying_detection/terraform
```

You will edit `your-default-aws-region` in the file `variables.tf`. Use the same values throughout the project. 

Initiate terraform and download the required dependencies-

```bash
terraform init
```

View the Terraform plan

```bash
terraform plan -var-file=vars/prod.tfvars
```

Terraform plan should show the creation of following services -

  - A S3 bucket to store ML model artifacts 
  - A ECR repository to store ML application container
  - A Lambda function to deploy streaming ML service
  - Two Kinesis stream
    - tweet_events
    - tweet_classification
  - IAM Policies and Roles to allow connection

Apply the infra. **Note** - Billing will start as soon as the apply is complete.

```bash
terraform apply -var-file=vars/prod.tfvars
```

Once you are done with the project. Teardown the infra using-

```bash
terraform destroy -var-file=vars/prod.tfvars
```

**Note:** The infrastructure was setup a tad generously, you might not actually be fully utilizing the compute power. Feel free to reduce the instance sizes and test.
